# Linear-Algebra
I computed the linear algebra part of my curriculum (using c++) the program solves linear equations of(NxN) dimensions using Gauss-jordian elimination (GJE), finds the inverse matrix using elementary matrix, finds the determinant of(NxN) matrix and does the basic matrix operations (addition, subtraction, matrices multiplication, scalar multiplication)
